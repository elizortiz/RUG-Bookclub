				<h2>UPCOMING BOOK</h2>
				<h3>Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo</h3>
				<p>The book is about struggle, love, joy and imagination. It culminates with her protagonists – black
					women of different generations, faiths, classes, politics and heritages, and a few men too – thrown
					together at a party for a soap opera-style grand finale.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Author's motivation for the book</h3>
				<p id="quote">"I wanted to put presence into absence. I was very frustrated that black British women
					weren’t visible in literature. I whittled it down to 12 characters – I wanted them to span from a
					teenager to someone in their 90s, and see their trajectory from birth, though not linear. There are
					many ways in which otherness can be interpreted in the novel – the women are othered in so many ways
					and sometimes by each other. I wanted it to be identified as a novel about women as well."</p>
