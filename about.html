         <h1>What is the Read, Understand and Grow Bookclub?</h1>
          <p1>  RUG is a book club dedicated to reading the works of Black and minority ethnic authors. <br>
              RUG's aim is for people to keep educating themselves about racism and other social injustices. <br>
              It is a pledge to commit to the fight against racism. <br>

          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p2>
        The RUG meets virtually once per month to discuss that month's book and exchange opinions about the topic the book touches upon.  <br>
        Head over to the 'Books' page to see what books the RUG community has already
        read, and head over to 'Home' to see the upcoming book and sign-up to be a RUG member. <br>
